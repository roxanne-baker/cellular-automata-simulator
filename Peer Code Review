Duplicated code in "updatePreyState" and "updatePredatorState":

* Written the current way because the rules for updating the two are fairly different
Perhaps consolidate into a single "update" function that takes in the state as a parameter




* Duplicated methods in SegregationSimulation and GameOfLifeSimulation:
Written the current way due to uncertainties about putting the methods in the superclass when the other two Simulation types are handled differently
Might put methods into superclass and modify the other two Simulations to be handled similarly to GameOfLife and Segregation


* Similarities in addCardinalNeighbors and addDiagonalNeighbors
Written the current way in order to make following code slightly more readable and avoid passing all booleans in as parameters (since that would be upwards of 10 parameters)
Could not define variables since only slight difference in readability, or have an addAllNeighbors method instead of addDiagonalNeighbors that could reduce some of the duplicated code
