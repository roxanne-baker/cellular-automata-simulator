###My Suggested Changes For David
- create another method inside step() that returns a Grid object. Call the method withthe cloned grid object in class Simlation and with new Grid object in class WaTorSimulation, then return.

###David's Suggestions
- David suggested to move the methods getInitialStates() and setInitialStates() from classes SegregationSimulation and GameOfLifeSimulation to the parent class Simulation.
